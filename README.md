# Full Stack JVM & JS App Hands-On Lab

This repository is the code corresponding to the hands-on lab [Building a Full Stack Web App with Kotlin Multiplatform](https://play.kotlinlang.org/hands-on/Full%20Stack%20Web%20App%20with%20Kotlin%20Multiplatform/).

**The master branch is to be used as a template. If you would like to see the completed project, check out the [final](https://github.com/kotlin-hands-on/jvm-js-fullstack/tree/final) branch.**

Just to get an idea if it is possible to make a full stack framework in Kotlin and it seems it is possible.

## MongoDB
The example uses MongoDB so if you would like to run it you will need to have a local Mongo running on the default port.

The community edition is fine. I am sure other databases can be supported but the example used Mongo and I quite 
like Mongo :)

## Run the project
```./gradlew run```
